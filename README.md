# projectify 

## About

projectify is an evolving project to help people plan out how to tackle their projects.

## Installation

Currently projectify is only a simple script, so all that is required is a working copy of Python 2.7.

## Usage

The user enters all the projects they are working on, how much time each will take, and the script estimates the completion date for each project. 

I wrote this as a proof of concept script to help myself manage the projects and courses I wanted to work on by:
1. Providing a quick (and realistic) way check when I can expect to finish a course or project by.
2. Forcing me to make a list. The only projects I seem make progress on are the ones I work on every day.

## History

V.1 - Script calculate an estimated date of completion for each project input by the user.
