# projectify 

## Installation

This is only a simple script, so all that is required is a working copy of Python 2.7.

## Usage

The user enters all the projects they are working on, how much time they will take, and the script estimates the completion date for each project. 

I wrote this as a proof of concept script to help myself manage the projects and courses I wanted to work on by:
1) Providing a quick (and realistic) way check when I can expect to finish a course or project by.
2) Forcing me to make a list. The only projects I seem make progress on are the ones I work on every day.

## History

V.1 - Script calculates time to complete one project

V.2 - Script provides date estimate of completion for each project input by user
